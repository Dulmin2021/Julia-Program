# Julia Data Analysis and Visualization

This project demonstrates basic data analysis and visualization using the Julia programming language. The project reads data from a CSV file, performs some data manipulation, and visualizes the results using a bar plot.

## Files

- `data_analysis.jl`: Julia script to perform data analysis and visualization.
- `data.csv`: Sample data file used in the analysis.
- `README.md`: This file containing project details.

You can install them using Julia's package manager:
```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add(["CSV", "DataFrames", "Plots"])
